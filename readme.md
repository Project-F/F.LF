## Run F.LF 
- [Video Tutorial: Run F.LF on Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdIfLtkQWZ0)
- Here're the steps to run F.LF on Windows
  - run the command: "git clone https://github.com/Project-F/F.LF"
  - inside local F.LF folder, run the command "git clone https://github.com/Project-F/LF2_19", this will create LF2_19 on local for the required game asset.
  - inside local F.LF folder, run the command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer" or any other web server you know. in my case, this web server ran at the port 8080 locally.
  - go to http://localhost:8080/ or whatever local port your web server is using.
