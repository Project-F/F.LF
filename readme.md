# F.LF - the open source LF2
[http://f-lf2.blogspot.com](http://f-lf2.blogspot.com)
F.LF is the show casting game for F.core. Where F.LF attempts a clean room implementation of the famous fighter game [LF2](http://lf2.net).

## Philosophy
F.LF attempts to re- create LF2 in a web browser, and be an open source clean room implementation. F.LF respects original LF2 in every detail, that data file compatibilty and program behavior will be regarded carefully.
F.LF will leverage web technologies as much as it can to make games "native to browsers".
I believe the web, open source and fine software will enable anyone, from novices to experts, to create great interactive contents and bring them to any other one.

## Compatibilty

### data files
F.LF provide a tool to convert xml-like LF2 data files into JSON.
## sprites
LF2 sprite images in 24bit bmp must be converted to 32bit png with transparency.
F.LF requires XXX.png to be mirrored into XXX_mirror.png.

## Status
F.LF is still in mid-stage development. Check out the latest milestone at [f-lf2.blogspot.hk](http://f-lf2.blogspot.hk/search/label/latest-demo).

## Install
F.LF is built upon [F.core](https://github.com/tyt2y3/F.core). F.LF contains purely source code. Materials from LF2 is converted and contained in [LFrelease](https://github.com/tyt2y3/LFrelease). Place all the repositories side-by-side.
