# Project information

### Motivation

LF2 has received significant recognition and popularity since its initial release. Being the most sophisticated fighter game being built in its time, LF2 is also extremely customizable with its data file architecture. Over the years, numerous modifications have been made, ranged from spriting, data changing to exe editing. A vast amount of related work, including comics, animations and novels, have been created by thousands of people from all over the world, creating a strong and truly amazing community.

It is very limiting of what we can do with a compiled executable even with techniques like exe editing. But development of LF2 has been dormant for some years while the author has no plan to open source it. In order to move forward, the community has to own a code base and have right and ability to develop on it. Let us take this first step to the continuity of LF2.

### Philosophy

F.LF attempts to re-create LF2 in a web browser, and be an open source clean room implementation. F.LF respects original LF2 in every detail, that data file compatibilty and program behavior will be regarded carefully. F.LF will leverage web technologies as much as it can to make games native to browsers.

### Architecture
Project F.LF is divided into two repositories, [F.LF](https://github.com/Project-F/F.LF) and [LF2_19](https://github.com/Project-F/LF2_19). F.LF is the game engine which implements ___the LF2 standard___ and provides gaming functionalities. LF2_19 contains material (sprites, data, sound, etc) converted from original LF2. Such that F.LF is source code only and contains no third party copyrighted material.

### Compatibility
F.LF thrives for 99% compatibility with LF2

- data
	- F.LF provide a [tool](../tools/data_file_converter.html) to convert xml-like LF2 data files into JSON.
- sprite
	- LF2 sprite images are in 24bit bmp and must be converted to 24bit png with defined transparent index (or 32bit png with transparency). for more read the [sprite conversion guide](conversion.html).
- sound
	- LF2 sounds are in wav and must be converted to ogg and mp3 for use with HTML5 audio.
- in general, materials should be compressed and converted to a format suitable for distribution and consumption on the web.

### Development
F.LF [development](develop.html) is close to production ready. For details read the [documentation](index.html).
