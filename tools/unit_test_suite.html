# Unit Test Suite
An automated unit test suite is essential for F.LF to deliver quality-guarantee software. However since LF2 is a game of computer simulation, unit test here differs from traditional sense in software engineering. The unit test suite is specifically developed for F.LF to simulate keyborad input and compare the output with a designated data set. It provides an objective, scientific and precise measurement of compatibility of F.LF to LF2. It facilitates development by providing errors and expected values in organized tables.

For more information, read [docs/unit_test_suite](../docs/unit_test_suite.html).
